# Spotify_Data_Analysis
In this project, we are going to explore my Spotify usage. Spotify is one of the most famous and popular music streaming platforms. The dataset used here showcases my personal usage of this platform. We downloaded this dataset from Spotify's Privacy Setting section, which allows anyone to download their personal usage data. With this dataset, we are trying to analyze users' streaming history to gain some useful insights.

For this EDA Project, we are going to use several tools such as Jupyter Notebook, Python, and Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and word cloud, Jovian.
